            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my story. This page documents the major milestones, lessons, and memories 
                that have shaped who I am today. Born in Tagum City in 2005, I have always believed 
                that life is full of hope but also challenges that we have to face, conquer all of the hardships to gain a peaceful yet satisfiying life.

            <h2>The Early Years</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in a small town where everyone knew me as, well "me".
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raised:</strong> Sto. Tomas, Davao Del Norte</li>
                <li><strong>Key Memory:</strong> Having a baby brother.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="path">
            <h2>Forging a Path</h2>
            <p>
                Before high school, I moved to Bansalan, Davao Del Sur, which was a massive culture shock. 
                It was there that I discovered my passion for loving Computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge I faced during this time was the time where my father left us 
                because of my mother being unfaithful, but overcoming it taught me that all things must come to an end, 
                where accepting what has been done is the way to forgive.

        <section id="now">
            <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
            <p>
                Today, I am currently a student in University of Mindanao. Looking back, I wouldn't change a thing. 
                I am currently focused on being myself more and to thrive even further than before.
